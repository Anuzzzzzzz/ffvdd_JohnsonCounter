A Johnson counter, also known as a "twisted ring counter" or "shift register counter," is a digital counter circuit commonly used in electronics and digital logic design. It operates as a circular shift register with bidirectional counting capabilities. These counters have 2^n states, with 'n' being the number of flip-flops used, making them suitable for counting modulo 2^n. They exhibit self-correcting behavior, automatically resolving errors caused by noise or disturbances. The counting sequence can be either the straight binary sequence or its complement, depending on the feedback connections

Johnson counters are popular for applications where a cyclic counting sequence or pattern is needed, and they are relatively easy to design and implement using flip-flops and appropriate feedback connections. They are used in scenarios where a continuous loop of values is required, and the bidirectional counting capability adds to their versatility.

Examples where Johnson counters are used:
1. Frequency Division: Johnson counters are commonly employed in frequency dividers. By using a Johnson counter, you can divide an input frequency by a factor of 2^n. This is particularly useful in applications like clock signal generation and frequency synthesis

2. LED Chasers and Light Effects: Johnson counters can be used in lighting and display applications to create various patterns and light effects. For example, LED chaser circuits use Johnson counters to sequentially activate LEDs in a circular pattern, creating an eye-catching moving light display
